=> # show mac address-table // Display the entire mac address table in a Switch

=> # show mac address-table dynamic // Display all the mac addresses learnt Dynamically.

=> # show mac address-table static // Display all the mac addresses configured manually.

=> # clear mac address-table // Clears the entire mac address table

=> # show mac address-table interface <interface_number> // Display all the mac addresses learnt through the specified interface of the Switch

=> By default MAC Addresses are learnt dynamically and they will be removed from the table after 300 seconds if no traffic.

=> You can manually set the aging time;

    SW01# mac address-table aging-time <time-in-seconds>

=> To avoid removing the entires from the MAC Address table, we can add it statically using the below command;

    SW01# mac address-table static <mac-address> vlan <vlan-no> interface <interface_name>
