PortFast:
=========

=> A feature used to avoid listening & learning states of switch ports. Which normally takes 30 seconds.

=> After enabling PortFast on a switch port it directly jumps to forwarding state.

=> Can be configured in two methods:
	1. Per-port:
		SW(config)# interface fa0/1
		SW(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast		

	2. Globally:
		SW(config)# spanning-tree portfast default

			This will only activate portfast feature on Access ports.

=> The following method is used to disable portfast on a specific interface;

	SW(config)# interface fa0/1
	SW(config-if)# spanning-tree portfase disable

=> The following command is used to verify portfast on a specific interface (fa0/1),

	Switch# show spanning-tree interface fa0/1 portfast
